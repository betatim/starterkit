<p>
  <a href="{{site.stk_site}}">The LHCb Starterkit</a>'s mission
  is to help LHCb scientists get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  The hands-on workshops will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
